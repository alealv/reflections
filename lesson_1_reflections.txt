How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It's very simple, I've just have to consentrait in lines where there is
	a "+" ==> add line and a "-"==> remove line. For better view I have to
	use "diff -u" rather than the default.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	I can have a history of the changes that have been made. Also allows to test
	results of improvments or not. And easily correct bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Pros: -versioning whenever I want ==> not having lot of commits for
		small changes

	Cons: - I have always to remember to commit after a change (important change)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
