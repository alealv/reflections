What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialized the directory .git is created, and I can start
	to make commits of my changes. Otherwise this would be imposible

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The Staging Area is a middle step before updating changes from the working
	directory to the repository. You can select some files to commit and some
	others not to. This gives advantage in separate commits into groups of related
	files.
	It also allows to make commits while one is not connected to the internet.
